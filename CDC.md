# Introduction
 This project has for goal to design and build an hiking stick holder for `lagal FR-03-061` hiking sticks. Specifications will be detailed later in the document.

# Fonctionnalities
## Main functionnality

 The main functionnality is to hold two sticks horizontally on the lower back of the user.

## Other fonctionnalities

 - The sticks have to be removable from the support.
 - The sticks have to be held firmly, less movement as possible from the back point of view.
 - The holder have to be removable from the user.
 - The holder should maintain itself alone on the back of the user, it will not be attached to external devices (bags, trouser, t-shirt).
 - The sticks should not be able to detach themself during the use, worst case is running.

## Optionnal functionnalities
 - Holding other thing in the front like little food bars.

# Constrains
## Space constrains

 The holder should be located in the lower back of the user. (cf [Owner references](#owner) for measurements). It should not stick out of the body shadow when looking from the front of the user. It should be usable with a running back pack located higher on the back.

 The lower back is not flat so it should adapte to the shape of the back. It may be assumed flat localy.

## Fabrication process

 Possible Fabrication process are :
 - 3D printing. Working space is 20\*20\*30. PLA only.
 - Simple wood working. Doable with hand tools or jigsaw and glue.
 - Aluminum tubing. Only cutting, no welding.
 - Screws and nuts
 - Strings
 - Hand sewing

## Hicking stick

 Hiking sticks are foldable ones in carbon. They are saparated in three pieces and pop out if you remove the little band holding it. The three rods have differents sizes but the one in the middle can be considered beeing constant in diameter on its whole it lentgh. When folded, the three rods are in a triangular arrangement with all length beeing side to side. (cf attached pictures)

 - Diameter of the middle part : 14mm
 - Lentgh of the parts : 410mm
 - Lentgh between parts axis when folded : 23mm


## User

 - back width :
 - back length :
 - average running pace :

 I don't have the average amplitude for my back vertical movement.
